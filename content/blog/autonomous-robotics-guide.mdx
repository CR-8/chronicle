## Introduction

Building your first autonomous robot can be an exciting journey. This guide will walk you through the essential concepts and steps to get your robot moving autonomously.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Basic programming knowledge
- A robot platform or simulation environment
- Understanding of sensors and actuators
- Familiarity with control systems

## Key Concepts

### Sensor Integration

Autonomous robots rely on sensors to perceive their environment:

- **Ultrasonic Sensors** - Distance measurement
- **Cameras** - Visual perception
- **IMU** - Orientation and acceleration
- **Encoders** - Position tracking

### Path Planning

Planning the robot's path is crucial for autonomous navigation:

1. Define the goal position
2. Identify obstacles
3. Calculate optimal path
4. Execute movement commands

### Control Algorithms

Common control approaches include:

- **PID Control** - For smooth and accurate movement
- **State Machines** - For behavior management
- **Neural Networks** - For advanced decision making

## Your First Implementation

Here's a simple example of autonomous navigation logic:

```python
def navigate_to_goal(current_pos, goal_pos):
    while not reached_goal(current_pos, goal_pos):
        # Sense the environment
        obstacles = detect_obstacles()
        
        # Plan the next move
        next_move = calculate_path(current_pos, goal_pos, obstacles)
        
        # Execute the move
        execute_move(next_move)
        
        # Update position
        current_pos = get_current_position()
```

## Next Steps

Once you have the basics working:

1. Improve obstacle avoidance
2. Add multiple waypoints
3. Implement mapping and localization
4. Optimize for speed and efficiency
