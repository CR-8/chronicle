# How to Calculate the Pull Force of Scissors Using a Motor

## 🧠 The Scenario

A stepper motor with a worm gearbox powers an industrial scissor system that cuts through brush materials.

Here's what we know:

- The motor produces **0.4 Nm** of torque
- The worm gear multiplies that to **20 Nm**
- The arm length is **0.15 m** (distance from pivot to where force is applied)
- The brush setup weighs about **1 kg**

Now, the challenge: find the **pull force** — the linear force at the end of the scissor arm.

## ⚙ The Physics Behind It (Simple Version)

Torque is basically "how hard something twists."  
Force is "how hard something pulls or pushes."  
They're connected by one simple relationship:

**T = F × r**

Where:
- **T** = torque (in Newton-meters)
- **F** = force (in Newtons)
- **r** = distance from the pivot point (in meters)

If you rearrange it to find force:

**F = T ÷ r**

That's it! You're just dividing the twisting power by how long the lever arm is.

## 🧩 Plug in the Numbers

F = 20 Nm ÷ 0.15 m = **133.33 N**

This means the scissors apply a pulling force of around **133 Newtons**, which is roughly equivalent to lifting about **13.5 kg** straight up.

That's quite strong — plenty for cutting lightweight materials like brushes or thin plastics.

## 🔍 But Wait… There's More

That's the ideal case. In real life:

- **Friction** in the gears and joints will reduce the actual output force
- The **scissor geometry** (angle and pivot placement) affects how efficiently input force turns into cutting force
- If your motor runs in steps, there could be slight **variations or vibration** during cutting

So while 133 N is the theoretical pull, you might only see around **100–110 N** of effective cutting force after losses.

## 📊 Quick Reference Table

| Parameter | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Motor torque | 0.4 Nm | Torque before gear |
| Gearbox torque | 20 Nm | Torque after worm gear |
| Arm length | 0.15 m | Distance from pivot |
| **Pull force** | **≈133 N** | **Linear force applied** |
| Real-world output | ~100–110 N | Accounting for losses |

## 💡 In Human Terms

Imagine holding a pair of scissors with a 15 cm handle, and you twist them with the same strength as lifting a 13 kg dumbbell.

That's the kind of pull force your motor setup can create — more than enough to slice through brush materials cleanly.

<Callout type="info" title="Pro Tip">
If you want to measure it practically:
1. Attach a spring scale (like a luggage scale) at the scissor arm's end
2. Apply power and see how much pull it exerts before cutting
3. Compare against your calculation

That'll give you a real-world confirmation of your math.

## 🛠 Practical Checklist

✅ Measure your actual torque output (test with a torque wrench or dynamometer)  
✅ Measure the pivot-to-blade distance accurately  
✅ Account for ~15-20% efficiency loss due to friction  
✅ Test with a load cell if precision is critical  
✅ Remember: more gear ratio = more force, but slower speed  

## 🧾 Final Thoughts

The user's curiosity about pull force led to a simple but crucial insight:

> You can always find linear force from torque — just divide by the radius (or arm length).

It's the kind of physics every robotic designer should have in their back pocket. Small math, big impact.
