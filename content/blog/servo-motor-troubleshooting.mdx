# When Your Servo Motor Starts Acting Weird — How to Tell if It's Broken

## 🧠 The Situation

A new robotics enthusiast got a kit with two continuous rotation servos. When they plugged both into a microcontroller:

- **Servo #1** just made a humming sound when commanded — but didn't move
- **Servo #2** didn't move at first — but when plugged in alone, it worked perfectly
- When both were connected, **only Servo #2 moved**
- **By hand**, Servo #1 spun way more freely than Servo #2 — about **60% easier to turn**

So… was one of the servos broken? Could it be fixed?

## ⚙ Understanding How a Servo Works

Let's start with the basics. Think of a servo as a **smart motor that knows where it is**.

Inside, it has:

1. **A motor** (the muscle)
2. **A gearbox** (to make it strong)
3. **A sensor** (to tell it its position)
4. **A controller** (to match what you tell it to do)

Most hobby servos — like the ones you use with Arduino — get a special **pulse signal**:

- A **1.5 ms pulse** tells it "stay in the center"
- A **shorter or longer pulse** makes it turn one way or the other

In a continuous rotation servo, that feedback is removed so it spins freely, with pulse width controlling **speed and direction** instead of position.

## 🧩 The Clues

Now, back to the humming and lack of movement.

Experienced roboticists on forums pointed out that **servos usually fail in two main ways**:

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="1. Gear Problems 🦷">

**What happens:**
Broken teeth, jammed gears, or something stuck inside

**Symptoms:**
- The servo hums but doesn't move
- Feels loose when turned by hand
- Moves unevenly or sticks

**Diagnosis:**
If a servo hums and spins easily by hand, gears are likely jammed or stripped.

**Fix difficulty:**
Easy to moderate (may be fixable with disassembly)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="2. Motor Problems ⚡">

**What happens:**
Worn-out brushes, overheated coils, or burned electronics

**Symptoms:**
- Doesn't move at all
- Sometimes cuts off power to other servos
- May smell like burnt plastic

**Diagnosis:**
If a servo is completely dead, it's likely motor or electronics failure.

**Fix difficulty:**
Hard to impossible (usually not worth repairing on hobby servos)
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

In this case, **the humming and easy hand rotation meant the gears were probably jammed or stripped.**

## 🧰 The Fix

The community suggested opening up the servo carefully.

When the user did — **they found jammed gears inside!** 😅

They simply:

<Steps>
<Step>
**Carefully disassembled** the servo casing (usually 4-6 small screws)
</Step>

<Step>
**Inspected all gears** for damage, debris, or misalignment
</Step>

<Step>
**Realigned the gears** to their correct positions
</Step>

<Step>
**Reassembled the case** and tested

Result: ✅ It worked perfectly again!
</Step>
</Steps>

**Lesson learned:** Sometimes it's not an electrical issue at all, just a mechanical jam.

## ⚠ When Servos Really Die

If your servo exhibits any of these symptoms, it's likely **gone for good:**

- 🔥 Smells like burnt plastic
- ☁️ Emits a tiny puff of smoke
- 🔇 Stops responding even after checking all connections
- 🔌 Causes power brownouts for other devices when connected

**Note:** Most hobby servos ($10–$30) aren't worth repairing unless they're high-end ($100+).

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Flowchart

```
Does your servo respond to commands?
│
├─ No response at all?
│  ├─ Check power and signal connections first
│  ├─ Try a different servo socket (might be an Arduino pin issue)
│  └─ If still nothing → Likely dead (motor/electronics failed)
│
├─ Humming but not moving?
│  ├─ Turn it by hand — does it spin freely?
│  ├─ If YES (easy to turn) → Jammed gears (try disassembly)
│  └─ If NO (hard to turn) → Stuck gearbox or bearing failure
│
└─ Moving but erratically?
   ├─ Check for loose internal parts
   ├─ Verify servo signal pulse is correct (1.0–2.0 ms)
   └─ May be a stripped gear tooth or worn bearing
```

<Callout type="info" title="Quick Diagnostic Test">
**Before opening the servo, try this:**

1. Connect the servo to power only (no signal)
2. Try to turn the output shaft by hand
3. If it turns **very easily**, gears are likely jammed
4. If it turns **with resistance**, bearings or motor may be stuck
5. If it doesn't turn **at all**, something is severely jammed or broken

This 10-second test tells you a lot!

## 💡 Key Takeaways

✅ A **humming servo that spins easily by hand** = likely gear issue (fixable!)  
✅ A **completely dead servo** = likely motor or electronics failure (retire it)  
✅ Always try **disassembly inspection** before throwing it away  
✅ Don't force servos under heavy continuous load — they can burn out  
✅ Continuous rotation servos are tougher than position-feedback servos for heavy work  

## 💬 Prevention Tips

- Avoid stalling your servo (motor pushing hard against resistance)
- Don't exceed recommended voltage or current draw
- Keep servos cool — they generate heat under heavy load
- Use quality servo arms and horns that won't strip
- Store servos in dry conditions (avoid moisture)

<Callout type="success" title="Servo Lifespan Pro Tip">
Most hobby servos last 1–3 years with regular use. If you're building a long-term project:
- Use industrial-grade servos ($50–$150) from brands like Dynamixel or Hitec
- Add a current-limiting circuit to protect against stalling
- Monitor servo temperature and cycle loads to prevent overheating

This investment pays off in reliability!

## 🧾 Final Thoughts

Sometimes, your robot's "broken" servo isn't dead—it's just stuck.

A little patience, a screwdriver, and some curiosity might save you a replacement.

**Robotics, like life, is all about learning to listen when things hum instead of move.** 😉
