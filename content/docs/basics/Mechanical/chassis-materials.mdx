## Load Distribution Analysis

### Center of Mass (COM)

Keep COM low and centered:

```
Unbalanced (BAD):
Heavy battery mounted high
└─ Tips over easily, unstable

Balanced (GOOD):
Heavy components mounted low
└─ Stable, predictable handling
```

### Distributed Load Calculation

Example: 20 kg mobile robot

```
Components (kg):
├─ Base plate: 2
├─ Motors (x4): 2
├─ Battery: 5
├─ Electronics: 1
├─ Gripper: 10
└─ Total: 20 kg

Load per corner (4-legged):
20 kg ÷ 4 = 5 kg per corner

Stress on mounting bolt (M5 aluminum):
Shear stress = Load ÷ Area
Area (M5) = 19.6 mm² = 0.000196 m²
Stress = 5 kg × 9.81 m/s² ÷ 0.000196 = 250 MPa
Safe? Yes (aluminum yield: 40 MPa) - but use larger bolt!

Better: Use M8 (50 mm²) = 100 MPa ✓
```

### Stress Points

```
Locations that fail first:
├─ Motor mounting points (vibration + load)
├─ Wheel axles (repetitive stress)
├─ Battery strap points (sudden acceleration)
└─ Electronic component solder joints (thermal cycling)

Solutions:
✓ Over-size all fasteners by 1-2 sizes
✓ Use lock washers and thread locker
✓ Add gussets at high-stress corners
✓ Isolate vibration with dampers
✓ Regular inspection for cracks
```

## Structural Design Principles

### Triangulation (Most Rigid)

```
Structure:
    A
   /|\
  / | \
 B--+--C

Benefits:
✓ Diagonal braces prevent flexing
✓ Three-point suspension is rigid
✓ Four-point can flex (become parallelogram)
```

### Gusset Placement

Reinforce at corners:

```
Without gusset:        With gusset:
    A                      A
   /|                      /|
  / |                     /||
 B  C      →             B |C
           └─ Gusset      \|
                           ↓
                        Rigid!
```

### Box Tubing Rigidity

```
Profile comparison (same cross-section area):

Solid rod:    Hollow tube:    Box tubing:
    |            O              □
    |          O   O            ◻
   
Rigidity:     1x               8x              12x

Best for robotics: Box tubing (strong and lightweight)
```

---

## Weight Balancing

### Front-to-Back Balance

Mobile robot example:

```
Unbalanced (nose down):
Heavy battery in front → Tips forward downhill

Balanced:
Weight distributed → Stable on any slope

Calculation:
COM = (m₁ × x₁ + m₂ × x₂) / (m₁ + m₂)
Adjust component position until COM = wheelbase/2
```

### Side-to-Side Balance

```
Left-to-right distribution:
Unbalanced → Drifts left/right in turns
Balanced → Straight-line tracking

Solution: Mirror component placement
```

### Height Matters

Lower COM = More stable:

```
High COM: Unstable, tips easily ┌─┐
                                │ │
                                │C│← High COM
                                └─┘

Low COM: Stable, won't tip ┌────────┐
                           │        │
                           │   C    │← Low COM
                           └────────┘
```

## Assembly Best Practices

### Fastener Selection

```
Bolt head threads into nut:
├─ M3: Micro assemblies, PCB standoffs
├─ M4: Small components, electronics
├─ M5: General assembly, sensors
├─ M6: Medium loads, motor mounts
├─ M8: Heavy loads, wheel axles

Material:
✓ Steel (strong, cheap)
✓ Stainless (corrosion resistant)
✓ Aluminum (non-magnetic, lightweight)
```

### Torque Values (Don't Overtighten!)

```
M4 bolt: 5-7 N⋅m
M5 bolt: 8-12 N⋅m
M6 bolt: 14-18 N⋅m
M8 bolt: 28-36 N⋅m

Rule: Tighten until snug, then stop
```

### Thread Locking

Prevent vibration loosening:

```
Options:
├─ Lock washers (cheap, obvious)
├─ Nylon-insert lock nut (reliable)
├─ Thread locker fluid (permanent)
└─ Split pin (simple, visible)

Application: All outdoor/moving robots
```

## Design Considerations

<Callout type="warn" title="Critical Design Factors">

**Rigidity:**
- Chassis flex causes sensor misalignment
- Wheels may not contact ground evenly
- Motors may work harder (more power draw)
- Solution: Over-dimension structural members

**Access:**
- Design for easy motor/battery removal
- Electronics should be replaceable
- Don't sandwich everything tight
- Solution: Modular panels

**Thermal:**
- Electronics generate heat
- Poor airflow → component failure
- Solution: Add vents, space components

**Vibration:**
- Motors create vibration
- Loose fasteners fail quickly
- Solution: Lock washers, thread locker, dampers

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **Chassis flexes** | Weak material or undersized members | Use next size larger extrusion, add bracing |
