## Drilling

### Drill Bits

```
Common sizes for robotics:

Metric:        (for M3-M6 bolts)
├─ 2.5 mm: Clearance for M2
├─ 3.3 mm: Tap hole for M4
├─ 4.2 mm: Clearance for M4
├─ 5.1 mm: Tap hole for M6
└─ 6.5 mm: Clearance for M6

Non-metric:    (imperial)
├─ #40 (3.2 mm): Small assemblies
├─ #10 (4.7 mm): Medium assemblies
└─ #F (6.6 mm): Large bolts

Material types:
├─ High-speed steel (HSS): General purpose, cheap
├─ Cobalt (HSSE): Harder materials, lasts longer
└─ Carbide: Very expensive, for production
```

### Drilling Technique

```
Steps:

1. Mark location with center punch
   └─ Small dent guides drill, prevents slipping

2. Start with pilot hole
   └─ Use smaller bit first (reduces wear)

3. Use cutting fluid
   └─ Aluminum: Cutting oil
   └─ Steel: Soluble oil (mixed with water)
   └─ Plastic: Light oil or dry
   └─ Benefit: Reduces friction, extends bit life

4. Drill with steady pressure
   └─ Let the drill bite (don't force)
   └─ Too fast → bit breaks
   └─ Too slow → dulls bit
   └─ Medium speed works best

5. Back out occasionally
   └─ Clears chips from flutes
   └─ Prevents jamming and bit breakage

6. Stop before bit exits
   └─ Last moment high pressure breaks bit
   └─ Slow down as you exit
```

### Drill Press vs Hand Drill

**Hand Drill:**
```
Pros: Portable, simple, inexpensive
Cons: Hard to keep vertical, less precise, slow
Speed control: Manual (squeezing trigger)
Best for: Quick holes, field repairs, single parts
```

**Drill Press (Stationary):**
```
Pros: Very precise, vertical guaranteed, handles large bits
Cons: Stationary (big workspace needed), expensive
Speed control: Belt/pulley adjustment, automatic feed
Best for: Production runs, precise holes, thick material
```

**Speed Chart (for drill press):**

| Material | Diameter | Speed (RPM) |
|----------|----------|------------|
| **Aluminum** | 3mm | 500-1000 |
| **Aluminum** | 10mm | 300-500 |
| **Steel** | 3mm | 300-500 |
| **Steel** | 10mm | 150-300 |
| **Plastic** | 3mm | 1000-2000 |
| **Plastic** | 10mm | 500-1000 |

## Cutting

### Hacksaw (Manual)

```
Best for: Cutting aluminum tube/bar

Technique:
1. Secure work in vise
2. Mark cut line with marker
3. Use steady downstroke, light upstroke
4. Keep blade perpendicular to work
5. Let saw do the work (don't force)
6. Last few strokes: slow pressure (prevent snap)

Speed: 1-2 inches (25-50mm) per minute

Maintenance:
├─ Replace blade when dull
├─ Keep blade teeth clean
└─ Check tension regularly (should be tight)
```

### Rotary Tool (Dremel)

```
Cutting discs: Small, fast cutting

Best for: Plastic, acrylic, thin aluminum

Technique:
1. Secure work properly (it will try to spin!)
2. Use low angle to material
3. Let tool speed do cutting (don't force)
4. Wear face shield (sparks!)
5. Keep hands clear of rotating disc

Speed: Very high (30,000+ RPM)
Result: Fast cuts but less precise than saw

Safety: Discs shatter if bent, can cause injury!
```

### Angle Grinder

```
Cutting discs: Large, powerful

Best for: Steel, thick aluminum

Setup:
├─ Large disc (4-5 inch)
├─ Very high speed (12,000 RPM)
├─ Powerful motor
└─ Serious tool!

Technique:
1. Secure work in vise or clamp
2. Wear full face shield (sparks fly far!)
3. Grip grinder firmly with both hands
4. Let disc speed do cutting
5. Don't twist disc in cut (will bind, throw work)

Safety: ⚠️ Respect this tool! Serious injury possible
```

### Water Jet

├─ Triangular file: Corners
└─ Needle files: Small details

Technique:
1. Secure work in vise
2. Cut on forward stroke (pressure)
3. Light on return stroke
4. Steady angle (don't rock)
5. Use full length of file

Best for: Final finishing touches, deburring
```

### Deburring

```
Removes sharp edges after cutting/drilling

Methods:
├─ Hand file: Manual, controlled
├─ Chamfer bit: Quick, consistent
├─ Sandpaper: Fine finishing
└─ Deburring tool: Specialized, expensive

Why important:
✓ Prevents cuts
✓ Improves appearance

└─ Silver solder: Stronger, more expensive
```

### Joint Preparation

```
Steps:
1. Clean surfaces
   └─ Remove oxidation with brush/sandpaper
   
2. Apply flux
   └─ Chemical cleaning agent
   └─ Helps solder flow
   
3. Heat joint (not solder!)
   └─ Temperature > solder melting point
   └─ Heat metal to accept solder
   
4. Apply solder
   └─ Solder flows on hot metal
   └─ Fills gap between parts
   
5. Cool without moving
   └─ Solder hardens
   └─ Joint is complete
```

### Joint Types

```
Lap joint (strongest):
  ┌─────┐
  │     │ ← Overlap area
  └─────┘

Butt joint (weaker):
  ┌─────┐ ┌─────┐
  │     │ │     │ ← No overlap
  └─────┘ └─────┘

Tee joint:
  ┌─────────┐
  │         │ ← T-shaped
  │    ┌────┘
  │    │
  └────┘
```

### Quality Assessment

```
Good solder joint:
✓ Shiny appearance
✓ Smooth surface
✓ Solder fully flows
✓ No voids or cracks

Bad solder joint:
✗ Dull/grainy appearance
✗ Lumpy surface
✗ Cold joint (not fully melted)
✗ Cracks visible

Fix: Reheat and reflow
```

## Material-Specific Techniques

### Aluminum

```
Characteristics:
├─ Low melting point (660°C)
├─ Corrodes easily
├─ Oxidation layer prevents bonding
└─ Excellent thermal conductor

Cutting:
✓ Use sharp blades (dull bits grab)
✓ High speed (2000+ RPM for small bits)
✓ Cutting fluid mandatory
✗ Slow feeds cause heating
✗ Soft metal – handle carefully

Drilling:
✓ Use aluminum-specific bits if available
✓ Slow speed (500 RPM for 10mm bit)
✓ Cutting fluid essential
✓ Support from underneath (prevent tear)

Welding:
✓ Use TIG or MIG with Argon gas
✓ Remove oxide layer with stainless wire brush first
✓ Higher heat than steel
✓ Cools quickly (can distort)

Best fastener: Aluminum or stainless (steel rusts in aluminum)
```

### Steel

```
Characteristics:
├─ High melting point (1500°C+)
├─ Very strong
├─ Rusts without protection
└─ Magnetic

Cutting:
✓ Medium speeds (200-500 RPM for 10mm bit)
✓ Cutting fluid important
✓ Steady pressure (doesn't require as much finesse)

Drilling:
✓ Standard HSS bits work well
✓ Slower speeds than aluminum
✓ Cooling fluid reduces bit wear
✓ Easier to drill than aluminum (less grabbing)

Welding:
✓ Any welding method works
✓ Stick welding most common
✓ Simpler technique than aluminum
✓ Cools slower (can distort even more)

Post-processing: Paint or powder coat for rust protection
```

### Acrylic (Plastic)

```
Characteristics:
├─ Low melting point (160-180°C)
├─ Brittle (cracks from stress)
├─ Transparent
└─ Lightweight

Cutting:
✓ Use band saw or rotary tool

✗ Slow speed causes melting
✗ Don't use abrasive discs (melt it)

Drilling:
✓ High speed (2000+ RPM for small bits)
✓ Light pressure (don't force)
✗ Metal drilling speeds melt it
✗ Twist drill bit recommended
✓ No cutting fluid (creates toxic fumes with acrylics)

Joining:
├─ Solvent bonding: Apply acrylic cement
├─ Mechanical: Bolts with washers (prevent cracking)
└─ Avoid welding (will melt)

Finishing: Polishing removes scratches and frost appearance
```

### Carbon Fiber

```
Characteristics:
├─ Extremely strong
├─ Lightweight
├─ Non-conductive (generally)
├─ Composite material (fiber + epoxy)
└─ Very expensive

Cutting:
