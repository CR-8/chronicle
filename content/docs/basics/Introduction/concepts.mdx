# Key Concepts in Robotics

Every robotic system, regardless of type or domain, relies on three fundamental concepts that work together in a continuous cycle: Perception, Decision-Making, and Actuation.

## The Sense-Think-Act Paradigm

This closed-loop cycle is what allows robots to:
- Understand their world
- Make intelligent decisions
- Take meaningful actions
- Learn from results
- Adapt to changes

## 1. Perception (Sensing)

Perception is the robot's ability to gather information about its environment and internal state through sensors and processing systems.

### Sensor Categories

<Tabs items={['Proprioceptive', 'Exteroceptive', 'Active vs Passive']}>

### Sensor Fusion

<Callout type="success" title="Sensor Fusion Benefits">
Combining multiple sensors creates more robust perception than any single sensor:
