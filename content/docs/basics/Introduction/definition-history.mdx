# Definition and History of Robotics

## What is a Robot?

A robot is a programmable machine capable of carrying out a series of actions automatically or with minimal human intervention. The term "robot" derives from the Czech word "robota," meaning forced labor, first introduced by Karel Čapek in his 1920 play "R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)."

### Key Characteristics of Robots

Every robot, regardless of its specific application, must possess certain fundamental characteristics:

- **Sensing**: Ability to perceive the environment through sensors (cameras, LiDAR, ultrasonic, etc.)
- **Processing**: Computational capability to make decisions based on sensory input
- **Actuation**: Mechanical components to perform physical actions (motors, actuators, hydraulics)
- **Programmability**: Can be instructed to perform different tasks through software or algorithms
- **Autonomy**: Varying degrees of independence from human control, from fully autonomous to teleoperated

<Callout type="info" title="Robot Definition Across Fields">
Different fields define robots differently:
- **Manufacturing**: Programmable manipulators that perform repetitive tasks
- **AI/CS**: Autonomous agents that perceive and act in environments
- **Mechanics**: Electromechanical systems that perform work
- **Service Industry**: Machines that assist humans in various tasks

## Historical Evolution of Robotics

The history of robotics spans over a century, from conceptual ideas to today's sophisticated AI-driven systems.

```

### Era 1: The Conceptual Age (1920-1950s)

**The Birth of an Idea:**
- 1920: Karel Čapek's play "R.U.R." introduces the term "robot"
- Initially, robots were purely fictional concepts in science fiction
- Early thinkers imagined machines that could perform human work
- No practical implementation existed yet

**Key Figures:**
- Karel Čapek: Popularized the concept through literature
- Isaac Asimov: Developed "Three Laws of Robotics" in science fiction stories

<Callout type="success" title="Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics">
Though fictional, these laws influenced robotics ethics:
1. A robot may not injure a human or allow a human to come to harm
2. A robot must obey human orders except where it conflicts with Law 1
3. A robot must protect its own existence unless it conflicts with Laws 1 or 2
