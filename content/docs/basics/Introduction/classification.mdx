# Classification of Robots

Robots can be classified based on their level of autonomy and the degree of human involvement required in their operation. This classification helps understand capabilities, limitations, and appropriate applications for different robotic systems.

## Three Main Classifications

<Tabs items={['Autonomous', 'Semi-Autonomous', 'Teleoperated']}>

### Latency Impact on Teleoperation

A critical factor in remote operation is communication delay:

**Mars Rover Challenge:**

- Signal delay: 3-22 minutes one-way
- Solution: Autonomous operation with human oversight
- Operators must pre-plan sequences rather than real-time control

**Underwater ROV:**
- Depth: Up to 6000 meters
- Communication: Fiber-optic tether (real-time)
- Advantage: Instant feedback to operator
- Disadvantage: Limited mobility due to tether

**Drone Operation:**
- Distance: Up to 50+ miles (FPV racing)
- Latency: Milliseconds
- Solution: High-speed wireless or line-of-sight
- Allows fast, responsive control

### Teleopresence Factor

Modern teleoperated systems emphasize "teleopresence" - making the operator feel physically present:

**Technologies:**
- Immersive VR headsets for operator
- Multi-camera systems for 360° view
- Force feedback (haptic feedback) systems
- 3D spatial audio
- Real-time sensor data visualization
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info" title="Boundary Blurring">
Modern robots often incorporate elements from all three classifications, switching between modes based on task requirements and context. For example:
- A surgical robot might operate semi-autonomously for routine positioning but allow teleoperation for critical incisions
- An autonomous vehicle might require teleoperated intervention in edge cases
- A warehouse robot might operate autonomously but accept human route adjustments
