# Batteries and Cells

Batteries are the lifeblood of mobile robots. Choosing the right battery type is critical for performance, runtime, weight, and safety. Understanding battery chemistry helps make informed decisions.

## Battery Chemistry Fundamentals

### How Batteries Work

A battery converts chemical energy into electrical energy through oxidation-reduction (redox) reactions:

```
Negative terminal (−): Oxidation (electrons released)
Electrolyte: Ions flow inside battery
Positive terminal (+): Reduction (electrons accepted)
External circuit: Electrons flow to power load
```

### Key Parameters

| Parameter | Unit | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| **Voltage (V)** | Volt | Electrical pressure |
| **Capacity (mAh/Ah)** | Amp-hour | Charge stored |
| **Energy (Wh)** | Watt-hour | Total usable energy |
| **C-rating** | Times | Discharge rate |
| **Self-discharge** | %/month | Charge loss over time |
| **Cycle life** | Cycles | How many times rechargeable |

### Example Battery Rating

```
12V 5000mAh 50C Li-ion

12V = Nominal voltage
5000mAh = 5 Amp-hour capacity
50C = Can discharge at 50 × 5A = 250A peak!
```

<Accordion title="Lithium Polymer (LiPo)">
### Why LiPo for Robots?

LiPo dominates robotics due to high power density and customizable form factors.

### Characteristics

| **Energy density** | 150-250 Wh/kg | Very high |
| **Power density** | High (50C typical) | Fast discharge available |
| **Cycle life** | 300-500 cycles | Moderate |
| **Cost** | Moderate | Competitive |
| **Self-discharge** | 2-3%/month | Low |
| **Temperature range** | −20 to 60°C | Good range |

### Advantages

✓ **High power output**: 50C means 250A from 5Ah battery
✓ **Lightweight**: Best energy per weight
✓ **Customizable**: Any cell count, any shape
✓ **Fast charging**: Can charge in 30 minutes
✓ **Temperature stable**: Good performance in cold

### Disadvantages

✗ **Expensive**: Most costly chemistry
✗ **Fire risk**: Flammable electrolyte if damaged
✗ **Care required**: Careful handling, storage, charging
✗ **Puffing**: Ages and swells over time
✗ **Shorter cycle life**: 300-500 cycles vs 1000+ for others

### LiPo Cell Variants

**1S LiPo cell** (3.7V nominal):
- Smallest unit
- Used in small racing drones
- Example: 1S 350mAh 75C

**Multi-cell packs** (2S, 3S, 4S, 6S):
- Series connection increases voltage
- Parallel cells increase capacity and current
- Example: 3S 5000mAh 50C (11.1V, 250A peak)

### Safety Considerations

⚠ **Fire hazard**: Puncture or short → thermal runaway
⚠ **Storage**: Keep at 40-60% charge in cool place
⚠ **Charging**: Use balanced charger only
⚠ **Disposal**: Recycle at electronics facility
⚠ **Transport**: Airline restrictions on LiPo batteries

### Example: Quadcopter LiPo

```
3S 5000mAh 50C
├─ 11.1V nominal voltage
├─ 5 Ah capacity
├─ 250 A peak current (50 × 5)
├─ ~55 Wh energy (11.1V × 5Ah)
└─ Runtime: ~20 minutes at 50% average power
```

- Voltage drops earlier in discharge

**Prevention:**
- Fully discharge occasionally (once per month)
- Charge fully before use
- Modern chargers can reverse memory effect

## Cell Configuration

### Series vs Parallel

**Series connection** (voltage addition):
```
+5V cell | +5V cell | +5V cell
         ↓ ↓
        +15V total

Capacity = single cell capacity
Current capability = single cell capability
```

**Parallel connection** (capacity addition):
```
+5V cell ┐
+5V cell ├→ +5V total
+5V cell ┘

Capacity = 3× single cell
Current capability = 3× single cell
```

### Example: 3S2P Battery Pack

```
3S = 3 cells in series (3 × 3.7V = 11.1V)
2P = 2 parallel groups

[Cell] ─ [Cell] ─ [Cell]
  ║       ║       ║
[Cell] ─ [Cell] ─ [Cell]
        ↓
      11.1V, 2× capacity, 2× current capability
```
