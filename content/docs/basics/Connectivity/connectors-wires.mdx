# Connectors and Wires

Proper connectors and wire sizing are critical for safety, reliability, and performance. Wrong choices lead to overheating, fires, or system failures.

## Wire Gauge Selection

### AWG (American Wire Gauge)

Wire size for different currents:

| AWG | Diameter | Current (safe) | Resistance | Best For |
|-----|----------|----------|------------|----------|
| **28 AWG** | 0.3 mm | 0.5 A | High | Signal wires |
| **24 AWG** | 0.5 mm | 2 A | Medium | Sensor wires |
| **20 AWG** | 0.8 mm | 5 A | Medium | Motor signals |
| **16 AWG** | 1.3 mm | 10 A | Low | Power distribution |
| **14 AWG** | 1.6 mm | 15 A | Low | Main power |
| **12 AWG** | 2.0 mm | 20 A | Very low | High-power systems |
| **10 AWG** | 2.6 mm | 30 A | Very low | Heavy-duty |

**Rule of thumb:**
```
Derating factor: 80% of table value for safety margin

Example: 16 AWG rated 10A
Safe continuous: 10A × 0.8 = 8A recommended
```

### Voltage Drop Over Wire

```
V_drop = Current × Resistance × Length

16 AWG (~0.004 Ω/foot):
1 foot @ 5A = 0.02V (acceptable)
10 feet @ 5A = 0.2V (5% of 5V, borderline)

Minimum requirement: < 3% voltage drop
Max length = (3% × Supply V) / (I × wire resistance)
```

## Common Connectors

### XT60 (Most Popular)

```
Current rating: 60A continuous, 150A burst
Voltage: 250V max
Uses: Battery to ESC, PDB

Connector structure:
┌─ Positive (large contact)
├─ Negative (large contact)
└─ Shroud (prevents short circuit)

Advantages:
✓ Cheap (~$1 pair)
✓ Common in drones
✓ Built-in shroud prevents shorts
✓ Easy soldering

Disadvantages:
✗ Not suitable for > 60A continuous
✗ Can wear out quickly with frequent plugging
```

### XT90 (High-Current)

```
Current rating: 90A continuous, 200A burst
Voltage: 250V max

Advantages:
✓ Higher current than XT60
✓ Spark-prevention circuit (optional)
✓ Robust contacts

Disadvantages:
✗ More expensive ($2-3)
✗ Slightly larger than XT60
```

### JST Connectors

```
PH series: 2.0mm spacing, small robot applications
XH series: 2.54mm spacing, common in hobby

Current: 2-5A typical (small)
Voltage: 250V

Use: Servo connectors, small battery packs
Advantage: Compact
Disadvantage: Low current, easy to disconnect accidentally
```

### Bullet Connectors

```
Sizes: 2.0mm, 3.5mm, 5.5mm
Current: 5A (2.0mm) to 30A (5.5mm)
Voltage: 250V

Use: Motor to ESC connections
Simple design, cheap, widely available
```

### Tamiya Connector

```
Old standard (still used in some applications)
Current: 10A typical
Issues: Unreliable, loose connections
Modern: Avoid, use XT60 instead
```

---

## Connector Selection by Current

```
< 2A: JST PH/XH
2-10A: XT60, 3.5mm bullet
10-30A: XT90, 5.5mm bullet, Anderson PowerPole
> 30A: Custom solution, heavy-duty connector
```

## Proper Soldering

### Solder Joint Anatomy

```
Good joint:           Bad joint:
┌──────┐              ┌──┐ ← Insufficient solder
│      │              │ │
└──────┘ Smooth       └─┘ Lumpy/cold joint
Shiny, convex        Dull, concave
```

### Solder Quality

**Lead-free (modern):**
- Melting point: 217-227°C
- Better for environment
- Slightly harder to work with

**Lead-based (old):**
- Melting point: 183°C
- Easier to solder
- Health hazard

### Soldering Steps

1. Heat both parts (connector and wire)
2. Apply solder to joint (not directly to iron!)
3. Heat until solder flows smoothly
4. Remove iron and let cool
5. Result: Strong, shiny joint

**Common mistakes:**
- Using too much solder (makes joint weak)
- Cold joint (solder didn't melt properly)
- Using flux-less solder (weak joints)

## Wire Color Coding

### Power Distribution

```
Red: Positive (+)
Black: Negative/Ground (-)
Yellow: Switched power
Orange: Auxiliary power
```

### Control Signals

```
White: Signal/Clock
Green: Signal/Data
Blue: Signal ground reference
```

### Best Practice for Robotics

```
Main power:
- Red thick wire from battery +
- Black thick wire from battery -

Motor connections:
- Power lines in red/black
- Signal wires in smaller gauge
- Label wires with shrink tube
```

## Wire Harness Construction

### Bundling

Organize wires in same direction:

```
Good:   Wires bundled together, velcro strap
        ↓
Bad:    Wires scattered all over robot
        ↗ ↙ ↖
```

### Labeling

Use heat shrink tube with labels:

```
Format: [FUNCTION]-[PIN]

Examples:
- MOT_LEFT_PWM-D3
- BATT_POS (marked with red)
- I2C_SDA-A4

Benefits:
✓ Easy troubleshooting
✓ Maintenance simplification
✓ Documentation
```

### Strain Relief

Prevent wire breakage at connector:

```
Without relief: Wire flexes right at connector → breaks
    [Connector]
         ↓ ← Flexing here

With relief: Strain distributed over longer area
    [Connector]
    [→Strain relief boot→]
              ↓ ← Bending here (better)
```

## Connector Maintenance

### Oxidation Prevention

Over time, contacts oxidize (turn green/white):

```
Contact cleaner: Use electronics-grade contact spray
Clean annually: Especially if robot not used regularly
Protecting spray: Thin coating prevents oxidation
```

### Preventing Loose Connections

```
Problem: Connection feels loose after many cycles

Solutions:
1. Check solder joint (might be cold)
2. Tighten connector screw (if applicable)
3. Use conformal coating (prevents corrosion)
4. Replace connector (if worn out)
```

## Safety Practices

<Callout type="warn" title="Electrical Safety">

**High-current hazards:**
- ⚠️ Never short battery terminals directly
- ⚠️ Use fuses/breakers for over-current protection
- ⚠️ Never modify high-current connectors while powered
- ⚠️ Keep water away from high-voltage systems (> 30V)

**Safe practices:**
✓ Always use correct wire gauge
✓ Check connectors before plugging in
✓ Use insulated tools for high-voltage work
✓ Wear insulated gloves for > 50V systems
✓ Never work on live circuits without need

## Common Connector Problems

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| **Loose connection** | Worn connector, cold solder | Replace connector or re-solder |
| **Connector won't fit** | Bent pins | Gently straighten or replace |
| **Melted connector** | Excessive current | Use larger gauge wire, bigger connector |
| **Green oxidation** | Exposure to moisture | Clean with contact cleaner |
| **Intermittent connection** | Corroded contact | Clean terminals, apply dielectric grease |
