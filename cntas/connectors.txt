Connectors in Robotics

Introduction - 
-Robots need electricity to move, sense, and think.
-Motors, sensors, and controllers need to be connected for power and information flow.
-Connectors are like plugs that join two wires so electricity can pass.
-Just like plugging in a phone charger, robots “plug in” their parts using connectors.

Common Connectors Used in Robots

1) FRC Connectors -
-Used in FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) robots.
-Strong, safe, and carry high power.
-Stay connected even when robot shakes or moves.
-Commonly used for battery and motor wires.
-Example: Anderson Powerpole (locks tightly but easy to unplug).

Advantages: Great for large and powerful robots.
Disadvantages: Slightly large and more expensive.


2) Dupont Connectors - 
-Small black plastic connectors for signal wires.
-Common with Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and small sensors.
-Found on jumper wires and breadboards.
-Useful for testing and learning projects.

Advantages: Cheap and easy to use.
Disadvantages: Can fall off if robot shakes or moves a lot.


3) RC Connectors -
-Used in RC cars, drones, and small robots.
-Carry medium to high power for batteries and motors.
-Examples:
	JST: Small red plugs for low power.
	XT30, XT60, XT90: Yellow plugs for stronger power.
	EC3, EC5: Larger blue plugs for even more power.
	Deans (T-Plug): Red T-shaped plug.

Advantages: Strong, compact, reliable.
Disadvantages: Requires soldering to attach wires.

4) T-Plug (Deans Connector) -
-Red T-shaped plug.
-Connects batteries to motor controllers.
-Carries high current (power).

Advantages: Very strong and secure.
Disadvantages: Can be hard to unplug if tight.

5) Male and Female Pins -
-Work like plugs and sockets:
-Male pin: Metal stick part.
-Female pin: Hole where male pin fits.
-Electricity flows when connected.
-Used in Dupont cables, Arduino boards, and jumper wires.

Advantages: Easy to connect and remove.
Disadvantages: Can wiggle loose if not secured.

6) Terminal Block -
-Small green or blue plastic block with screws.
-Wires are inserted and screws tightened to hold them.
-Used for:
	Power distribution
	Motor connections
-Testing circuits or building setups

Advantages: Strong, reusable, no soldering needed.
Disadvantages: Takes more space and longer to set up.
