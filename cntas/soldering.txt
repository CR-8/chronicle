SOLDERING 

1. What is Soldering?
Soldering is like gluing metal parts together using melted metal glue called solder. When solder melts and cools, it forms a strong and conductive connection.

2. Why is Soldering Used?
Soldering is used to connect electronic parts so electricity can flow. It is used in phones, TVs, toys, speakers, etc.

3. What is Solder?
Solder is a metal that melts easily. It melts before the wires do, so we can join wires safely.

4. What is Flux?
Flux is like cleaning helper. It removes dirt from metal so solder can stick properly.

5. How Soldering is Done (Steps)
1. Heat the metal area using soldering iron.
2. Touch solder to the hot area so it melts.
3. Let it cool and harden.

6. Types of Wires
- Solid Wire: One thick piece, strong but not bendy.
- Stranded Wire: Many thin wires, very flexible.
- Tinned Wire: Copper wire coated so it doesn’t rust.

7. Component Mounting on PCB
- Through-Hole: Component legs go through holes.
- Surface Mount (SMT): Component sits on the surface.

8. What a Good Solder Joint Looks Like
- Smooth
- Shiny
- Cone-shaped
- Not cracked or dull

9. Safety Tips
- Don’t touch hot iron tip.
- Don’t breathe smoke.
- Work in open air.
- Wash hands after soldering.
