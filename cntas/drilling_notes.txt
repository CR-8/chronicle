DRILLING – DETAILED THEORY NOTES

1. Introduction
Drilling is a machining process used to create a cylindrical hole in a solid material using a rotating cutting tool called a drill bit. When the drill bit rotates and moves into the material, it cuts and removes material in the form of chips. Drilling is mainly used in metalwork, woodwork, construction, and manufacturing to create holes for bolts, screws, wiring, assembly, and fitting components.

2. Parts of a Drilling Machine
- Base: Supports the machine and absorbs vibration.
- Column: Vertical support holding main components.
- Table: Platform where the workpiece is positioned and clamped.
- Spindle: Rotating shaft that holds and turns the drill chuck.
- Chuck: Device that grips the drill bit.
- Motor: Provides power for rotation.
- Feed Handle: Used to push drill bit into material.

3. Types of Drill Bits
- HSS (High Speed Steel) Bit: Used for metal, plastic, and wood.
- Carbide Bit: Very hard and used for drilling hard materials.
- Masonry Bit: Used for concrete, brick, and stone.
- Brad Point/Wood Bit: Designed for smooth wood drilling.
- Spade Bit: Used for large diameter holes in wood.
- Hole Saw: Used for very large circular holes.

4. Types of Drilling Processes
- Drilling: Creating a new hole.
- Reaming: Slightly enlarging a hole for precision fit.
- Boring: Increasing hole diameter to a larger size.
- Tapping: Creating internal threads for screws and bolts.
- Counter Sinking: Creating conical entry for screw heads.
- Counter Boring: Enlarging hole entrance to seat bolt heads.
- Spot Drilling: Making a guide mark to improve accuracy.

5. Drilling Parameters
- Speed (RPM): Rotational speed of drill bit. Higher for soft materials, lower for hard materials.
- Feed Rate: Speed at which drill advances. Too high feed can break the drill bit.
- Coolant/Lubricant: Used during drilling to reduce heat and increase tool life.

General Material Rules:
- Wood: High speed, low feed.
- Steel: Medium speed, medium feed.
- Hard Metals: Low speed, low feed with coolant.

6. Types of Drilling Machines
- Hand Drill: Portable, for basic use.
- Bench Drill (Drill Press): Mounted on table, for precision small work.
- Pillar Drill: Floor-mounted, powerful for industrial use.
- CNC Drilling Machine: Computer-controlled for automated precision drilling.

7. Safety Precautions
- Wear safety goggles to protect eyes.
- Clamp the workpiece securely.
- Keep hair, clothing, and accessories away from rotating drill.
- Do not force the drill; let it cut naturally.
- Use coolant while drilling metal to avoid overheating.

8. Characteristics of a Good Drilled Hole
- Smooth internal surface.
- Correct and accurate diameter.
- No burrs or rough edges.
- Hole should be centered properly.

9. Applications
- Machine and vehicle part manufacturing.
- Construction and building work.
- Carpentry and furniture making.
- Electrical installation and wiring.
- Mechanical assembly operations.

Conclusion
Drilling is an essential manufacturing and workshop process used to create accurate and strong holes in various materials. Proper selection of drill bit, drilling speed, feed rate, and safety precautions ensures high-quality results and long tool life.
