Wheels in Robotics

Wheel - 
-A circular part that allows a robot to move.
-Can be made of rubber, plastic, metal, or other materials.

Diameter -
-The distance across the wheel through its center.
-Bigger wheels cover more distance per rotation.

RPM (Revolutions Per Minute) -
-How many times the wheel rotates in one minute.
-Higher RPM → wheel spins faster → robot moves faster.

Speed -
-How fast the robot moves (distance per time).
-Depends on wheel diameter and RPM.

Torque -
-Rotational force applied to the wheel.
-More torque → wheel can move heavier loads or climb slopes.

Load -
-The weight the robot carries.
-More load requires more torque to maintain speed.

Distance Traveled -
-How far the robot moves.
-Depends on number of wheel rotations and wheel diameter.

Material -
-The wheel’s substance (Nylon).
-Affects grip, friction, durability, and slip.


Relations Between the Terms

Wheel Diameter → Distance per Rotation
Larger diameter → wheel covers more distance per rotation.
Distance traveled = Wheel Circumference × Number of Rotations
Circumference = π × Diameter

RPM & Speed -
Speed = (Wheel Circumference × RPM) ÷ 60
Faster RPM → higher speed for same wheel diameter.

Torque & Load -
More load requires higher torque to maintain same RPM.
Torque needed ∝ Load × Wheel Radius

Diameter & Torque -
For the same torque, larger wheels accelerate slower but cover more distance per rotation.
Smaller wheels → faster acceleration, less distance per rotation.

Material & Friction -
Material affects grip and slip.
Low-friction wheels → less torque needed but may slip.
High-friction wheels → better grip but may need more torque to move.

Distance Traveled -
Distance traveled = Number of Wheel Rotations × π × Diameter
Can also be controlled by speed and time: Distance = Speed × Time
