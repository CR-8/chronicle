WELDING

What is Welding?
Welding is like gluing metal pieces together, but instead of using glue, we use heat to melt the edges so they mix and stick forever when cooled. It makes the two metals become one solid piece — strong and permanent.

How Does It Work?
1. Take two metal pieces.
2. Heat them very hot.
3. Their edges melt a little.
4. The melted parts mix.
5. They cool and become one.

Sometimes a filler rod is added, like extra melted metal glue for strength.

Types of Welding:
- Arc Welding: Uses electricity (like a tiny lightning spark).
- Gas Welding: Uses fire from burning gas.
- Resistance Welding: Press metals and pass current.
- Laser Welding: Uses a laser beam.
- Friction Welding: Rubbing metals until hot.

Kinds of Joints:
- Butt Joint: Side by side.
- Lap Joint: One over another.
- T-Joint: Makes a “T” shape.
- Corner Joint: At a corner.

Tools Used:
Helmet, gloves, welding machine, electrode or torch, and sometimes shielding gas.

Safety:
- Never look at the bright welding spark.
- Wear gloves and helmet.
- Keep fire extinguisher nearby.
- Work in fresh air.

Common Issues:
- Porosity: Tiny trapped gas holes.
- Cracks: Cooled too fast.
- Spatter: Metal droplets fly out.
- Weak weld: Not enough heat.

Where Welding is Used:
Cars, buildings, ships, airplanes, pipelines, and machines.

Simple Summary:
Welding = Melt + Mix + Cool = One strong metal piece.
